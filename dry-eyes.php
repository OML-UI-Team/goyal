                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>When tears can't adequately lubricate the eye, dry eye develops.</p>

                    <p>The likelihood of developing dry eye conditions rises with age. Additionally, it occurs more
                        frequently in post-menopausal women. The eye could become dry, irritated, and red. The main
                        signs of dry eyes are discomfort and light sensitivity, and dryness can be lessened with
                        lubricating and prescribed eye drops.</p>

                    <p>Your eyes may sting or burn if you have dry eyes. In some circumstances, such as on an aeroplane,
                        in an air-conditioned room, while riding a bike, or after staring at a computer screen for a
                        while, dry eyes can cause utmost irritation.</p>

                    <p>You might feel at ease after receiving dry eye treatments. Changes in lifestyle and eye drops are
                        examples of these treatments. To manage the symptoms of dry eyes, you'll probably need to go for
                        a consultation with an ophthalmologist.</p>

                    <p>Eye drops for dry eyes are used to lubricate eyes and help maintain moisture on the outer surface
                        of your eyes. Such eye drops may be used to treat dry eyes that result from ageing, certain
                        medications, a medical condition, eye surgery, or environmental factors, such as smoky or windy
                        conditions.</p>

                    <h5>Dry Eyes Causes</h5>
                    <p>Numerous factors interrupt the normal tear film and cause dry eyes. Fatty oils, aqueous fluid,
                        and mucus are the three layers that make up your tear film, and this mixture often maintains the
                        lubricated, smooth, and clear surface of your eyes. Dry eyes can result from issues with any of
                        these layers.
                    <p>There are several causes of tear film failure, including hormonal changes, autoimmune disorders,
                        inflammatory glands in the eyelids, and allergic eye conditions. Reduced tear production or
                        increased tear evaporation may cause dry eyes in some people.</p>

                    <p><strong>If you have dry eyes, be aware of the circumstances that are most likely to make them
                            worse.
                            Then, figure out how to avoid those circumstances for dry eye prevention. For

                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Don't let the air blow in your eyes:
                            Avoid shining fans, air conditioners, automobile heaters, or hair dryers directly into your
                            eyes.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Increase the air's humidity: A
                            humidifier can add moisture to the dry interior air throughout the winter and prevent dry
                            eyes.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Think about donning a pair of wraparound
                            sunglasses or other safety eyewear: To protect against wind and dry air, safety shields can
                            be fitted to the tops and sides of eyewear. Inquire about shields at the eyewear store.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Spend some time with your eyes closed:
                            Alternately, blink many times for a few seconds to assist your tears to fall evenly across
                            your eyes.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Be mindful of your surroundings: High
                            altitudes, arid regions, and aircraft cabins can all have exceptionally dry air. Close your
                            eyes for a few minutes to prevent tear evaporation while in such an atmosphere.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Position your computer screen below eye
                            level: You will open your eyes wider to observe the computer screen if it is higher than eye
                            level. To avoid widening your eyes, place your computer screen below eye level. This might
                            prevent your tears from evaporating too quickly in between eye blinks.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> During prolonged tasks, take eye rests:
                            Take regular eye breaks if you're reading or working on something that requires visual
                            focus.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Stop smoking and avoid doing it: If you
                            smoke, get your doctor's advice to develop a quit-smoking plan that has the best chance of
                            success for you. If you don't smoke, avoid being among smokers. Smoke might make symptoms of
                            dry eyes worse.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Regularly use artificial tears: Even
                            when your eyes feel OK, if you have chronic dry eyes, utilise eye drops to keep them
                            adequately lubricated.</li>

                    <h5>Artificial Tears</h5>
                    <p>Artificial tears are eye drops used to moisturise the outer layer of your eyes and lubricate dry
                        eyes. These eye drops may treat dry eyes brought on by ageing, specific drugs, a medical
                        condition, ocular surgery, or external causes, including windy or smoky environments.</p>
                    <p>Dry eyes can be treated with artificial tears over the counter, and no single product is best for
                        all cases. Before you locate the best brand, you should test a few others.</p>
                    <p>In addition to moisturising your eyes, some artificial tears encourage eye healing, while others
                        aim to slow down tear evaporation. Thickening agents, which retain the solution on the surface
                        of your eyes for longer, may also be present in artificial tears.</p>

                    <h5>Eye Drops for Dry Eyes Treatment</h5>
                    <p>There are various kinds of eye drops available for dry eye treatment. Preservatives are either
                        present or absent in over-the-counter (OTC) eye drops, often known as artificial tears or
                        lubricating drops, and they are offered as a liquid, gel, or cream.</p>
                    <p>Prescription eye drops reduce inflammation and encourage the production of more tears. They're
                        for cases of more extreme dry eye.</p>

                            frequently comes in multidose bottles and contains substances (preservatives) that prevent
                            bacteria from growing once the bottle has been opened. The preservatives may irritate your
                            eyes if you have moderate or severe eye dryness.</li>

                            to severe eye dryness because it has fewer ingredients. Eye Drops without preservatives
                            could be sold in single-dose vials.</li>
                        <li><i class="fas fa-check text-extra-medium-gray"></i> Additionally, non-prescription gels and
                            gel inserts for artificial tears are offered. These could result in a brief Blurry Vision.
